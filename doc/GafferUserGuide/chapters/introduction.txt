== Introduction to Gaffer anchor:introduction_introductionToGaffer[]
!!!!Welcome. This would be some text introducing people to Gaffer and its capabilities.!!!!

Gaffer is a 3D content creation application !!!!that is built around procedurally defined scenes!!!!. Its primary use is as a lighting and look-development (shading) tool, but its modular nature allows for customisation and expansion for use in other aspects of CGI production.   !!!!into other    areas.!!!!


















Gaffer is a ... application built around the core concept of scenes defined procedurally by networks of nodes.

but due to its modular nature its possible to expand the app to tackle a range of tasks.

the app as potential to be expanded into other cgi fields  aspects  tasks











It provides non-destructive methods for constructing and modifying scenes and sending the resulting scenes to render. Gaffer is not tied to any specific renderer, and can be 
extended to support any renderer currently implemented in the +++<a href="http://code.google.com/p/cortex-vfx/">cortex</a>+++ framework.
In addition to processing of 3D scenes Gaffer has simple 2D compositing functionality, allowing for renders and other imagery to be combined, and for the application of basic image manipulations.

The framework with which the Gaffer tool is built is also available for rapid development of both command line and GUI applications. More details on the framework and its use are available from the +++<a href="https://github.com/ImageEngine/gaffer/wiki">project site.</a>+++


=== Design Overview anchor:introduction_designOverview[]
!!!!What is the core design philosophy of Gaffer and how should users approach it?

.......two core parts to the design of gaffer, the way the scene recipe is defined using a graph and the deferred evaluation of the scene and render time.....!!!!

!!!!script -> scene   defines    which gaffer then generates on demand!!!!



=== Functionality anchor:introduction_functionality[]
!!!!What can Gaffer do?!!!!

=== Using this guide anchor:introduction_usingThisGuide[]
!!!!The user guide is structured thusly. Some simple tutorials are included, but extra in depth tutorials are available HERE.  Nodes also have tooltips that contain useful information, and that information is collated in the GafferNodeReference document.!!!!

The GafferUserGuide provides!!!!!!!!


As the Gaffer workflow employs some concepts that may be unfamiliar to users, special emphasis is placed on terminology thoughout the user guide.

To refer to components of the interface (as apposed to generic concepts), this document will stick to the convention of *UpperCamelCase*.  So for example, we might talk about the *NodeGraph* being used to manipulate a node graph.  In this case the *NodeGraph* is part of the GUI, where as the 'node graph' is a network of nodes created by the user.

In addition, some aspects of the application will be referred to by both the name given to them 'behind the scenes' and by terms related more to everyday usage.  It can be helpful for users to have some awareness of the mechanisms behind their actions so these will be exposed where appropriate.  As an example of this, the user guide might talk generically about manipulating items in a scene then go on to discuss the fact that an item is represented internally as a *location* in a *scene graph*.  Here the emphasis indicates that 'location' and 'scene graph' are technical terms.
