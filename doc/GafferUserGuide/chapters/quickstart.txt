== Quick Start Guide anchor:quickstart_quickStartGuide[]

This tutorial is designed to give new users a their first exposure to the workflow in Gaffer. Brief explanations of each step will be given, but there is no expectation at this stage that readers will fully understand the process. It is more likely that working through this tutorial will provide some exposure to various parts of the program; practical experience that should be helpful as you work through the rest of the user guide.

So let's dive in:

=== Launch Gaffer

* Follow the steps detailed in the xref:installation_launchingGaffer[installation chapter] to launch Gaffer. You should be presented with the default UI *layout*.

=== Create a sphere

* Locate the *NodeGraph* editor. This should be in the lower left portion of the window.
* `right-click` within the bounds of the NodeGraph to pop-up a menu for creating nodes. 
** 'Be patient as the menu can take a little while to build first time round.'
* Navigate this menu to find the "Sphere" node.
** The path is Scene -> Source -> Primitive -> Sphere
* You should now be able to see a sphere in the *Viewer*.

=== Adjust the sphere

* Locate the *NodeEditor*. This should be in the upper right portion of the window.
* This panel controls the parameters used to generate the sphere, as well as properties of the node itself.
* At the top of the editor change the "Node Name" from "Sphere" to "SphereA". This will change the label used to identify the node in the node graph.
* Within the "Settings" tab, change the "Name" parameter from "sphere" to "sphereA". This changes the name of the object created in the *scene*.
* Change the "Radius" parameter from 1 to 2. You should see the sphere get twice as big in the viewer.
* Next, switch to the "Transform" tab, and tweak the "Translate" control to move the sphere up by 2 units in the Y axis.

=== Add a plane

* Go back to the NodeGraph, and `left-click` in the empty space to clear the current selection.
* Then press `tab` to launch the node creation menu again.
* Type "plane" then `Enter`.
* This should create a new node in the graph, and you should see some geometry forming a plane in the Viewer.
* In the NodeEditor, set the "Dimensions" to 20, 20.
* On the "Transform" tab, set the "Rotate" X value to 90 in order to lay the plane down flat.

=== Group the geo

* In the NodeGraph, select both the nodes that have been created. They should appear highlighted.
** Either hold down `SHIFT` and `left-click` to pick multiple nodes, or `left-click-drag` to draw a selection box around all the nodes you want to pick.
* Keeping the two nodes selected, create a "Group" node (`right-click`, Scene->Scene->Group).
* Gaffer will automatically connect the outputs of both the "SphereA" and "Plane" nodes to the inputs of the new "Group" node.
* The group node introduces a new level to the scene hierarchy, and parents the inputs scenes underneath that *location*.
* Use the NodeEditor to set the "Name" of the new item in the hierarchy to "geoGroup".

=== Inspecting the hierarchy

* You may have noticed that when we created the group node, the display in the Viewer changed. Instead of showing the geometry, it switched to drawing a bounding box. 
** This is because the hierarchy changed and in the default state (collapsed) we only see the bounding box of the top levels.
* Locate the *SceneHierarchy* tab. This should be in the lower right portion of the window.
* Click the small horizontal arrow head next to "geoGroup" to expand the hierarchy.
* You should now see "plane" and "sphereA" listed underneath "geoGroup".
** The indentation indicates that these are parented to "geoGroup".
* The Viewer should have updated to show you both the sphere and the plane together (where as previously we saw only the output of the individual nodes in isolation).
* In the SceneHierarchy, click on "sphereA" to select that item. The ball geometry should become highlighted in the Viewer.
** Note how the selection in the hierarchy (the scene) is distinct from the selection in the graph.
* Move your mouse over to the Viewer and press `f` to frame the view around the current scene selection.

=== Adding a camera

* Back in the NodeGraph, click in empty space to clear the selection.
* Then create a "Camera" node (`right-click`, Scene->Source->Camera)
* Clear the selection again, and create group node with no connections.
* From the base of the tile representing the "Camera" node, `left-click-drag` on the dot and keeping the mouse press down move over to the dot on the top of the "Group1" node.
* Release the mouse. You should now have a connection running from the "Camera" node to the "Group1" node.
* Perform the same drag to connect action to join the original "Group" node into the second dot on the top of the "Group1" node.
* `left-click-drag` on the middle of the tiles to move them around in the NodeGraph.
** Try to arrange them to look like the picture below.
** Take care to ensure the connections match those shown in the image.

=== Positioning the camera

* Start by naming the group that combines the geometry and the camera.
** Select the "Group1" node.
** In the NodeEditor set the "Name" control to "rootGroup"
* Go to the SceneHierarchy and recursively expand the new scene by `SHIFT-left-clicking` on the arrow head next to "rootGroup".
** You should now see the camera in alongside the ball and plane in the 3D viewport.
* Back in the NodeGraph, select "Group1" and create an "AimConstraint" node (`right-click`, Scene->Transform->Aim Constraint).
** This node will let us target the camera at the contents of the scene.
* Make sure the output of "Group1" is connected to the left most input of the new aim constraint.
* In the NodeEditor, click the folder icon next to the "Target" field.
** This will pop-up a dialog that allows you to browse the scene hierarchy and pick specific locations.
** We want to select the item our camera should be aimed at.
** So `double-click` on the "rootGroup" entry in the dialog and keep navigating until you find "sphereA" (rootGroup->geoGroup->sphereA). Select it and press OK.
* Next we need to tell the AimConstraint what item it should be affecting. In this case we want to affect the camera.
** Still with the AimConstraint node selected, go to the NodeEditor and switch to the the "Filter" tab. 
** Click the "Add..." button and select "PathFilter" from the drop down.
** Click the "+" button that appears to add a path field to the filter list.
** In this new field, type `/rootGroup/camera`.
* Now the camera is constrained to point at the sphere. We want to move the camera from the default position, but it would be nice to see the result of the constraint whilst we do this.
** To make that happen, ensure the "AimConstraint" node is selected, then go the the Viewer and click in the circle icon on the top right of the Viewer panel. The center of the circle should go white.
** This has 'pinned' the Viewer, so that even if you select different nodes in the graph, the Viewer will stay focused on the scene output from the "AimConstraint" node.
* We can now select the "Camera" node and switch to the "Transform" tab in the NodeEditor. 
* Set "Translate" Y to 5.
* Hold `ctrl` and `left-click-drag` in the "Translate" Z field. You should see the camera moving backwards and forwards whilst maintaining its aim on the sphere.
* Move the camera until you are happy with its placement.

=== Setting up for render

* Now that we have the layout of our scene defined, we want to do a quick test render to check everything is working ok.
* To start setting things up for rendering, lay down a chain of three nodes attached to below the AimConstraint. We need:
** A "StandardOptions" node,
** A "Displays" node, 
** And a "RenderManRender" node.
* The connection order of the two middle nodes doesn't matter, but the chain needs to start and end with the "AimConstraint" and the "RenderManRender" respectively.
** I.e. AimConstraint->StandardOptions->Displays->RenderManRender
* Alongside these nodes create a "Display" node. This node does not take any inputs, so we don't need to connect it into the graph. Place it off to the side of the "RenderManRender" node.
* Go back and select the "StandardOptions".
** This node is responsible for setting up the basic properties of your render, such as which camera to use and what resolution the resulting image should be.
** In the NodeEditor, exapand the "Camera" controls group, then use the scene browser dialog to select "/rootGroup/camera" as the camera to use.
* Now select the "Displays" node. 
** This node creates a list of outputs to generate when rendering (display drivers in RenderMan terms). 
** In the NodeEditor, press the "+" button and select Interactive->Beauty from the drop down menu. This will create an interactive render buffer we can view within the Gaffer app.
* In order to be able see the render, we want to pin the "Display" the Viewer panel. This way we can interact with other nodes, but see the any renders we execute as they happen.
** To achieve this, hover the mouse pointer over the "Display" node in the NodeGraph and `middle-click-drag`. Holding down the middle mouse button, move the pointer up to the Viewer panel, then let go. This should swap the Viewer focus to the "Display" node and set the tab to pinned all in one action.
* At this point we will need to save the Gaffer script. In order to kick off a render Gaffer needs a file on disk to execute.
** Go to the menu bar and select File->Save as... and use the file dialog to save the session somewhere. 
* Finally, select the "RenderManRender" node and in the NodeEditor, click "Execute". If everything has gone to plan, you should see a grey ball on a grey plane!
** If that doesn't work:
** 'Double check you have the Display node selected and active in the Viewer.'
** 'Try pressing `f` to frame the Viewer to the image - it is possible the image is panned off to one side'
** 'Look in the shell Gaffer was launched from for error messages'
*** `Unable to find mapping for output path` 'could indicate that the camera specified in the StandardOptions has its name spelt incorrectly, or the hierarchy has changed since it was selected.'
*** `ERROR : Display::setupServer : Address already in use` 'suggests communication with the frame buffer has failed for some reason. Do you have another Gaffer session open?'

=== Assigning some shaders

* Grey balls are all well and good, but we want to take a first pass at assigning some shaders to the geometry.
* To make the scene more interesting we're going to add a second sphere to sit alongside the first.
** In the NodeGraph select the "SphereA" node.
** Press `CTRL-c` then `CTRL-v` to copy and paste a duplicate of the original node.
** Using the NodeEditor, rename the new node to SphereB and change the "Name" control to "sphereB".
** On the "Transform" tab, set the "Translate" X value to 4.
** Back in the NodeGraph, drag from the output nodule of the SphereB into the right most plug of the "Group" node.
** Use the `middle-click-drag` to view the "Group" node in the Viewer tab.
** By default, you will just see the top level bounding box. Use the SceneHierarchy to expand the scene tree.
* Now, go back to the NodeGraph and rearrange the nodes to make room in between the "AimConstraint" and the "StandardOptions".
* Select the "AimConstraint" and then create a "ShaderAssignment" node (Scene->Attributes->Shader Assignment)
** This node is responsible for attaching shader definitions to items in the scene hierarchy.
* Click off in the space to the left of the new node, and create another node: RenderMan->Shader->architectural 
** 'The exact contents and arrangement of the RenderMan->Shader submenu is going to depend on the renderer you are using (and the particular version). If "architectural" is not available, choose another general purpose surface shader.'
* Drag from the output of the new shader node over to the right most plug on the "ShaderAssignment" node, creating a connection between them.
* So that we can quickly see the result of this shader, set its "i_ambient" parameter value to 1,0,0 via the NodeEditor.
* The last step we need to do is to tell Gaffer which objects to assign this shader to.
** For this we need a path filter:
*** Select the "ShaderAssignment" node, then click the "Add..." button.
*** From the drop-down select "PathFilter".
*** Click the "+" button that appears to add a path.
** We could enter the full path to the object here. But to demonstrate a more procedural approach we're going to use a very simple expression to make the filter.
** In the path field, enter `.../*A`.
** This will match any item in the scene who's name ends with "A", e.g. "sphereA".
* Following the same steps from the last section, kick off a render, and view the results by pinning the "Display" node.

.Now we have a garish red shader assigned to sphereA.
