	"""
	Appends render passes to the scene globals.

	Render passes can be used to define named variations of a scene.
	These can be rendered by dispatching a RenderPassWedge node downstream
	of your render node of choice, or written to disk by dispatching
	a RenderPassWedge node downstream of a SceneWriter.

	Scenes can be varied per render pass based on the value of the
	`renderPass` context variable, which will contain the name of the
	current render pass being dispatched. `${renderPass}` can be used
	on the `selector` plug of Spreadsheet or NameSwitch nodes to choose
	specific plug values or branches of the node graph per render pass,
	and its value can be queried using Expression or ContextQuery nodes.

	> Tip : The list of render passes is stored in the `renderPass:names`
	> option in the scene globals.
